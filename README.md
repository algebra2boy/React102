# React102
This repository contains all the JavaScript React learning material I, Yongye Tan, gathered from Codepath.

Projects:
1. **[Computer Science Community Board](https://github.com/algebra2boy/React102/tree/main/Project/community%20board):**
This web app, named Computer Science Amherst Club Board. The site boasts a unique theme designed to highlight events or resources that pertain specifically to a community, and displays a minimum of 10 distinct resources or events in a dynamic card format. Notably, each card has buttons or links that connect to related resources, and the overall site is adaptable to both desktop and mobile formats. An additional touch to enhance the user experience is that hovering over text alters its background color.

2. **[SwiftUI Learning](https://github.com/algebra2boy/React102/tree/main/Project/swiftui%20learning):**
This React application serves as a resource to aid users in learning SwiftUI in an engaging manner. It was constructed over a span of 3 hours. The main page showcases the title of the card set, along with pertinent details such as a brief description and the total card count. At any given time, only one card is displayed, revealing just one side of the information pair. Users can interact with the card to see its corresponding data, and a subsequent card is presented upon clicking the "next" button. The cards are not just textual; some contain images or have distinct visual styles based on their category. Color coding has also been implemented: easy cards are green, medium are yellow, and hard ones are pink.

3. **[SwiftUI Learning (Advanced)](https://github.com/algebra2boy/React102/tree/main/Project/swiftui%20learning_2):**
This enhanced React application facilitates SwiftUI learning in a fun and interactive manner, all developed in 3 hours. Within the app, users are prompted to input their guess about a card before viewing its flip side. Immediate feedback is provided when the "submit" button is pressed, indicating the accuracy of the user's answer. For easier navigation, "back" and "next" buttons are strategically placed on the card. Users also have the option to shuffle the card order or get some leniency in answers that are close to the target. Additionally, there is a counter that tracks both current and record streaks of correct answers. Mastery is rewarded: cards deemed "mastered" by users are removed from the answer pool and added to a special list.

4. **[Cat The Lover](https://github.com/algebra2boy/React102/tree/main/Project/cat):**
A delightful website crafted in 5 hours, "Cat The Lover" caters to feline enthusiasts. Every button click triggers a fresh API fetch request, unveiling at least three unique attributes from the incoming JSON data. The user experience is kept streamlined, showing just one API call result at a time and ensuring randomness in API calls. Each call guarantees the display of a minimum of one image. Interactivity is a core feature: clicking on a displayed attribute value adds it to a ban list, thereby excluding results with that attribute in subsequent displays. Advanced features include the capability to ban multiple attribute types and a functionality that lets users revisit previously viewed items from their current session.

5. **[Brew](https://github.com/algebra2boy/React102/tree/main/Project/breweries):**
The "Brew" web application offers a comprehensive directory of U.S. breweries. Utilizing an API, it presents a list of breweries and provides a dashboard highlighting key statistics: the state with the most breweries, the predominant brewery type, and the overall count of breweries. Users can effortlessly search and filter the data, enhancing the browsing experience. Challenges faced during its 4-5 hour development included state management and prop distribution across components. The app stands as a testament to efficient data presentation and user-centric design.
